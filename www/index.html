        <h3>About:</h3>
        <p>
            I work on campus as a Local Support Provider for the Division of Academic Engagement and Student Affairs.</br>
            Tutoring and Learning Resources is one of the departments that we service.</br>
            </br>
            One of the staff members asked me if I could create a time management calculator for students as they were</br>
            currently using another university's website.</br>
            </br>
            Wanting to practice my programming skills, I created this calculator in May 2024, but they have yet to see about</br> 
            getting it added to their deparment site.</br>
            </br>
            I figured I would take the opportunity to show off my work given we are allowed to modify the html files in this project.</br>

        <h3>Side Note:</h3>
        <p>
            I also created a client-only Windows 11 app in C# using WPF for the Dean of Student's food pantry; another department that we service.</br>
            The app stores inventory information and transactions of items that students get, then stores the data in a local SQLite database.</br>
            </br>
            That was a fun project to work on, but it took me the entire month of August 2024 to complete.</br>
            They just started using it this semester, so I am happy to see that it is being used.</br>
